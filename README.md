## What is Aelo?

Aelo is a financial management app created as a part of CS50 final project. This app was built on top of frameworks like Angular and Django and was integrated via restful API's. The word Aelo has its root from my mother tongue (Urdu), meaning "here you go".

## Aelo's pain points

Being a bachelor, I felt it hard to keep track of all transaction that we made via cash, UPI, bank transfer, ATM cards, coupons and what not.
Do you remember last time that you and your friend went on a tour, and you taking responsibility of all cash dealings? There was onepoint of time, where I lost two transaction from my mindfulness. Thus I present you my Aelo app.

## Features

Aelo is packed with features like

- Complete list of transactions done till date
- Monitoring cash in-flows and out-flows per month
- Visualization of frequent transaction category
- Visualization of metrics like bank balance with respect to time
- Token based authentication for secured logins
- Restfull api for developers to access
